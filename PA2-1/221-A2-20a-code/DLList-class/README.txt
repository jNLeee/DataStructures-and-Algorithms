Resources:
Dr. Leyk's lecture slides on Doubly Linked Lists were used as a resource for this assignment.

Issues:
There are no problems with the assignment as it compiles without any errors and outputs correctly. 

Short Code Description:
A DLList class was created to implement various functions of a doubly linked list for integers. The following rule of 5 functions were implemented to provide optimized copies from temporary objects: deconstructor, 
copy constructor/assignment, move constructor/assignment. There were also multiple insert and remove functions for first/last/before/after to demonstrate how they work for doubly linked lists. Lastly, the overloading 
output operator was made to print out all the nodes in a list.

Testing:
The assignment was tested through a provided test file called DLList-main.cpp, where we are asked to only add extra test cases for the insert and remove before/after functions. The test cases were selected based 
on ensuring that all the doubly linked list functions were implemented and outputted correctly. Exception handling was used in multiple functions to check if there was an empty list with nothing inside, in which
it would throw EmptyDLList().
